# CustomCompoundAmmoBoxes

Adds ammo boxes in the compound for guns that use custom rounds.

Also check out: [MagLoaderThing](https://github.com/CiarenceW/MagLoaderThing), this un-cuts a thing in the Compound that makes reloading big magazines easy, goes along very well with this :)

## Installation
- Install the [latest BepinEx 5 release](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.21) </br>
- Extract the `CustomCompoundAmmoBoxes` folder to (where you have Receiver 2 installed) `Receiver 2\BepInEx\plugins`, very important that you don't rename the folder or change the file structure :)

## Usage
- Go to the compound, and pickup a gun that has a modded cartridge. It should appear next to the Mag Loaders, if you have that installed.  
- If you see a white box, that means that the round that you have doesn't have a custom model for it. Don't panick, it's up to the modders to do that.
